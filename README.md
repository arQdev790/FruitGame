The goal of the game is to sucessfully buy all 3 needed fruits without running out of money. The program gives you the option to retry if you did not accoomplish buying your fruits on the first 3 tries. If you win, then at the end you will get a fact about each fruit you bought, along with a list of how many fruits are sweet, sour, or both. Have fun!
